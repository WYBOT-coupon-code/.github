Here are three positive points where WYBOT shines:

2. **Affordable Cordless Innovation**: Starting at $399.99 (C1) and up to $999.99 (S2), WYBOT offers cordless cleaners with app control and wall climbing at a lower price than Polaris Freedom Plus ($1399) or Dolphin Nautilus ($799, corded), making high-tech features accessible to budget-conscious buyers.
3. **Versatile App Customization**: The WYBOT app (on S2 and C1 Pro) provides Wi-Fi control with up to seven cleaning modes, offering more granular control than Polarisâ€™ limited app or Aiperâ€™s basic app, letting users tailor cleaning for specific pool needs with ease.
